# 🏦 Finance Reconciliation Engine (Production-Style Data System)

A production-inspired data engineering system designed to reconcile financial datasets between Cash and RADA systems in a simulated banking environment.

The system demonstrates how enterprise financial institutions detect mismatches, maintain data integrity, and produce reconciled reporting layers for downstream consumption.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

In financial institutions, transaction data is sourced from multiple systems that often:

- Arrive at different times
- Contain inconsistent formatting
- Include duplicates or missing references
- Require regulatory-level accuracy

This leads to:
- reconciliation breaks
- manual investigation effort
- delayed financial reporting
- operational risk

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is built using a layered data engineering approach:

1. **Ingestion Layer**
   - Loads raw Cash and RADA datasets

2. **Standardisation Layer**
   - Cleans and normalizes data
   - Ensures consistent formats across systems

3. **Key Construction Layer**
   - Builds composite business keys
   - Prepares data for deterministic matching

4. **Reconciliation Engine**
   - Performs record matching logic
   - Classifies records into:
     - Matched
     - Unmatched
     - New
     - Cleared

5. **Output Layer**
   - Produces reporting-ready datasets
   - Feeds Power BI dashboards or downstream systems

---

## 🧠 Core Engineering Logic

The system uses deterministic matching based on:

- Account identifiers
- Trade references
- Settlement dates
- Value attributes

Reconciliation is performed by comparing:

- Current dataset vs previous snapshot
- Business key alignment
- Field-level comparisons

---

## ⚙️ Production Considerations

This system is designed with enterprise patterns in mind:

- Idempotent pipeline execution
- Modular transformation layers
- Separation of ingestion and processing logic
- Extensible matching rules
- Audit-friendly outputs

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Matched transactions dataset
- Unmatched exceptions dataset
- Cleared records dataset
- Power BI-ready reconciliation layer

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- SQL
- Data Engineering principles
- Optional: Spark / Databricks concepts
- GitHub Actions (CI simulation)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python pipelines/orchestration_flow.py
